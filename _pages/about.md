I am interested in
- ðŸ§  Artificial Intelligence
- âœ¨ Open-endedness
- ðŸ¦¾ Robotics
- ðŸ¦Ž Artificial Life
with a particular focus on learning to adapt to unforeseen situations in open-ended environments.

I am dedicated to breaking new ground in enabling robots to not just perform a task, but to acquire a breadth of general capabilities, mirroring the evolutionary adaptability found in nature. I also have interests in Metamathematics, Neuroscience and Consciousness.

Alongside my PhD studies, I teach both undergraduate and postgraduate students, _Deep Learning_, _Mathematical Methods Tutorials_ and _Python Programming_, totaling 300 hours/year. My responsibilities include lecturing, conducting tutorials and workshops, developing and grading coursework, and managing modules.
