I am interested in\
&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ§  Artificial Intelligence\
&nbsp;&nbsp;âœ¨ Open-endedness\
&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ¦¾ Robotics\
&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ¦Ž Artificial Life\
with a particular focus on learning to adapt to unforeseen situations in open-ended environments.

I am dedicated to breaking new ground in enabling robots to not just perform a task, but to acquire a breadth of general capabilities, mirroring the evolutionary adaptability found in nature. I also have interests in Metamathematics, Neuroscience and Consciousness.

Alongside my PhD studies, I teach both undergraduate and postgraduate students, _Deep Learning_, _Mathematical Methods Tutorials_ and _Python Programming_, totaling 300 hours/year. My responsibilities include lecturing, conducting tutorials and workshops, developing and grading coursework, and managing modules.

I am also an organizer of the Imperial College Autonomous Reasoning & Learning ([ICARL](https://icarl.doc.ic.ac.uk)) seminar series
- Each month, ICARL hosts a seminar series at Imperial College London, where we invite Artificial Intelligence researchers to give a presentation about their work.
- I am responsible for the setup of the lecture theatre and technical equipment (microphones, video cameras, online meeting and so on) to ensure high-quality recordings for our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ICARLSeminars).
